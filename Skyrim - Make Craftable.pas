{
  Script generates recipe COBJ record for selected WEAP/ARMO records, with item requirements, perk conditions and prefixes.

  NOTE: Should be applyed on records inside WEAPON/ARMOR (WEAP/ARMO) category of plugin you want to edit (script will not create new plugin)
  NOTE: So script works with Weapons/Shields/Bags/Bandanas/Armor/Clothing/Amulets/Wigs... every thing, but script won't find right item requirements for crafting wig or amulet... probably... However it will make a recipe, and it will log a message with link on that recipe, in this case, you can simply delete the record or edit it... that is your Skyrim after all :O)
