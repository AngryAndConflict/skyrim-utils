# skyrim-utils
[SSEEdit](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/164/?) scripts and utilities library to provide higher level of abstraction for everyday modding of Skyrim.

## SSEEdit usage
For basic usage in [SSEEdit](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/164/?), you will only need SkyrimUtils.pas and scripts you want to use (like Skyrim - Make Temperable.pas). Put these files into your 'xEdit/Edit scripts' folder.

## Contribution
Any help and suggestions of any sort are always welcomed. Please keep in mind, that SkyrimUtils.pas is auto-generated file, for production only, all its actual functions and sources are present inside utils-src folder.

## individual scripts
### Skyrim - Make Craftable
Automatically generates Crafting recipe for selected WEAP/ARMO records. Adds all needed conditions and requirements. Required items will be selected according to items Keywords, if script can't do that - it will give a message in log with link on created recipe without required items.

### Skyrim - Make Temperable
Automatically generates Tempering recipe for selected WEAP/ARMO records. Adds all needed conditions and requirements. Required items will be selected according to items Keywords, if script can't do that - it will give a message in log with link on created recipe without required items.

### Skyrim - Generate Enchanted Versions
Automatically generates Enchanted Versions for selected WEAP/ARMO records.
Currently Script generates 31 enchanted copies of selected weapons per each, adds enchantment, alters new records value, and adds respected Suffixes for easy parsing and replace.
* For armors script will make only one enchanted copy per each, for now.
* All enchanted versions will have it's propper Temper COBJ records as well.
* For each selected record, will be created an individual Leveled List, with Base item + all it's enchanted versions. Each with count of 1, and based on enchantment level requirement
* Script works with Weapons/Shields/Bags/Bandanas/Armor/Clothing/Amulets/Wigs... every thing, but script won't find right item requirements for tempering wig or amulet... probably... However it will make a recipe, and it will log a message with link on that recipe.

## SkyrimUtils functions
#### isTemperable(recordToCheck: IInterface): boolean;
Determines if item has a tempering recipe. Note: it is looking by "Referenced By", so if item originates inside Skyrim.esm, you have to "build" Skyrim.esm's reference before running script, or function result can be compromised.
``` pascal
if isTemperable(getRecordByFormID('020023EF')) then
  AddMessage('Already temperable item: ' + Name(getRecordByFormID('020023EF')));
```
#### isCraftable(recordToCheck: IInterface): boolean;
Determines if item has a crafting recipe. Note: it is looking by "Referenced By", so if item originates inside Skyrim.esm, you have to "build" Skyrim.esm's reference before running script, or function result can be compromised.
``` pascal
